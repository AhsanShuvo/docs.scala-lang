## Core Library Contributions

There are several options for contributing to Scala's core libraries. You can:

* Help with [Documentation](/contribute/documentation.html).
* [Report Bugs or Issues](/contribute/bug-reporting-guide.html) against the core libraries.
* [Fix Bugs or Issues](/contribute/guide.html) against the
  [reported library bugs/issues](https://github.com/scala/bug).
* Contribute significant new functionality or a new API by submitting
  a Scala Improvement Process (SIP) Document.

### Submitting a SIP

For significant new functionality or a whole new API to be considered for
inclusion in the core Scala distribution, you will be asked to submit a SIP (Scala Improvement Process) document.

Please see [instructions for submitting a new SIP](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/sip-submission.html) and familiarize yourself with the [SIP](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/) section of the Scala documentation site. Also please pay particular attention to the pre-requisites in the instructions before submitting a SIP.
