The Scala programming language is an open source project with a very
diverse community, where people from all over the world contribute their work,
with everyone benefitting from friendly help and advice, and
kindly helping others in return. So why not join the Scala community and help
everyone make things better?

## How to help?

### Reporting bugs

See our [bug reporting guide](./bug-reporting-guide.html) to learn
how to efficiently report a bug.

### Help with the documentation

An easy but very important way to contribute to Scala is to
[help with the guide/tutorial-style documentation on docs.scala-lang.org](http://docs.scala-lang.org/contribute.html).
If you want to [contribute to Scala standard library API docmentation](./contribute-scaladoc.html), the
process is slightly different, since API documentation lives within Scala standard library source code.

### Compiler and other tools

Want to dive into the hardcore business? Check out our
[selection of community tickets](./community-tickets.html),
which are good starting points to contributing to the compiler and
surrounding tools, like ScalaDoc.

More info in our [contributing guide](./guide.html).
