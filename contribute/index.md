- This page should contain the introduction as mentioned in the Scala Doc team google document
- Subpages or subsections for contributing for each project (i.e. how to find tickets/features to work on)
- Building and contributing code (contributor's workflow)
  - link to a proper git etiquette page
  - link to CLA
  - how to run and use partest
  - compiler page (links to compiler-related docs i.e. reflection/macros/compiler-plugin guides, links to compiler internal videos, and useful info from wiki) (or should this go on docs.scala-lang?)
- Link to how to make a bug report

The Scala programming langauge is an open source project from École
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. The source of the
compiler and libraries is hosted on [github](http://github.com/scala/scala).

Some aspects of the language are easier to contribute to than others-- the
compiler, for example, is arguably the most difficult part of the Scala
project to successfully submit patches to.

If you're interested in joining our community and contributing to the project,
start simple-- often Scaladoc (Scala's javadoc-like tool, Example: [Scala
Standard Library API](www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#package)) is
the best place to get started.
