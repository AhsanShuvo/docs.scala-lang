To clone the repo, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty.git
cd dotty
```

You can use [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) with your favourite text editor for things like code completion.

You need to have [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to work with the repo, as it is defined as an sbt project.
