This guide documents the inner workings of the Scala 3 compiler, `dotc`,
and is intended to give new contributors the knowledge they need to
become productive and fix issues or implement new features.

### A Note on Compiler Stability

Keep in mind that the code for `dotc` is subject to change, with no
guarantees of stability, so the ideas discussed in this guide may
fall out of date, please consider contributing to this guide
on [GitHub](https://github.com/scala/docs.scala-lang/tree/main/_overviews/scala3-contribution).

### Get the Most from This Guide

`dotc` is built with Scala 3, fully utilising its [new features](/scala3/new-in-scala3.html).
It is recommended that you first have some familiarity with Scala 3
to get the most out of this guide. You can learn more in the [language reference](/scala3/reference/overview.html).
