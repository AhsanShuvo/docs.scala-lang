## Core Library Contributions

There are several options for contributing to Scala's core libraries. You can:

* Help with [Documentation](/overviews/contribute/documentation.html).
* [Report Bugs or Issues](/overviews/contribute/bug-reporting-guide.html) against the core libraries.
* [Fix Bugs or Issues](/overviews/contribute/guide.html) against the
  [reported library bugs/issues](https://github.com/scala/bug).

### Significant changes

For significant new functionality or a whole new API to be considered for inclusion in the core Scala distribution,
please take into account [https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/661] before doing so.
