   - you need to have a clear understanding of the code
   - contact library author or scala-internals
   - write technical details and how to use snippets
   - fork scala/scala as in the hacker guide
   - change doc comments
   - submit a pull request
 - how can I contribute to the docs.scala-lang.org website?
