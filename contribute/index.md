## How to help?

### Reporting bugs

See our [bug reporting guide](./bug-reporting-guide.html) to learn
how to efficiently report a bug.

### Help with the documentation

An easy but very important way to contribute to Scala is to
[help with the documentation](http://docs.scala-lang.org/contribute.html).

### Compiler and other tools

Want to dive into the hardcore business? Check out our
[selection of community tickets](./community-tickets.html),
which are good starting points to contributing to the compiler and
surrounding tools, like ScalaDoc.

More info in our [contributing guide](./guide.html).
